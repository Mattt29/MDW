Choice of a Problem

Dear students,

As lecturers, the main objective in assessing this document "Choice of a Problem" as well as your oral presentation of it is to make sure you are on the right track for the final report. Consequently, unless there is a big problem, you should not expect to get a bad mark for this assignment. (Receiving a poor mark would be a warning that your team needs to urgently take some actions if you want to deliver something valuable at the end of the course.) You should thus really focus on trying to explain, as best (and concisely) as you can, what you plan to do in the remaining weeks to ensure we can provide you with useful feedback.

To mimic a workplace scenario, where your future boss's time is very valuable, you are asked to summarise your "plan of attack" in only two pages. Sticking to the report template provided on Moodle will help you in this task (and will also ensure some consistency for the marking across the lecturers). **This report is due next Tuesday, October 6, at midnight** (and no later than Wednesday, October 7 at 4 pm) to allow your boss (i.e., your lecturer here) enough time to review it before the following oral discussion. A single submission for each group is expected.

You are allocated a time slot of 30 minutes for this oral discussion. It is divided into 10 min of an oral presentation of your report (by one or several members of the team), followed by 10 min of questions (asked by the lecturer), followed by 10 min of questions you will ask the lecturer to help you improve your plan of attack. **Please see on Moodle for the exact time this discussion is scheduled for your team next Thursday and make sure you are available via the Zoom link provided on Moodle.**

Assume your boss knows nothing about the problem. You are strongly advised to start by presenting the problem brought by the client (i.e., the sponsor), including a brief introduction of who is the sponsor and why this problem is important for them. Next, you need to define what is _your_ project, which should be a meaningful refinement of the initial problem that takes into account your own constraints/resources. These constraints are mainly the time (you only have about 5 weeks left), but also the skills and knowledge the members of your team already possess. It is far better to aim low and to deliver, rather than to aim too high. Remember that this is a data science project. Thus, in describing how you will solve this refined problem, as (data) scientists, you are expected to **justify every aspect in your proposal**. For instance, if you decide to use a deep learning model, you have to justify why. Is it really the best model to solve your problem? (It is always better to use a simple model that you understand well and that is easy to interpret rather than a fancy model that is not appropriate or too difficult for you to handle given your constraints.) The literature review can help you to justify some of your choices. If a specific model is advocated to solve your problem (or a similar problem) in recent articles published in quality journals, then this is a good justification (you are following the lead of experts in the field). Your initial exploration of the data might also inform you on the best approaches to use. You should also discuss your constraints, e.g., do you already have some knowledge of the statistical or machine learning model you intend to use? do you have access to the proper computing infrastructure? are you skilled enough in the pieces of software you plan to use? did you assign a specific task to the member of the team that is the best qualified to handle it? are you using efficiently all the resources of the team? After your 10 min oral presentation, your lecturer might thus ask a lot of questions to ensure that you can adequately justify all your choices and activities. He might also ask how you will ensure the complete reproducibility of your results.

As already mentioned, we will also take into account the following aspects: a clear definition of the problem; a clear description of the data (variables, format, missing and corrupt values, etc.); the level of difficulty of the chosen data sets (size, complexity, messiness); the appropriate choice of software and statistical methods to solve your research questions; the precision of your scheduled activities. But given the space constraints in this first assignment, you should not provide too many details at this stage.

Have a nice weekend.
